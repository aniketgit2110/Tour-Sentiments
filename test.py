Hampta Valley is known for its magnificent views of the mountains and adventure sports and has the 4,250 m-high Hampta Pass that serves as a corridor between Lahaulâ€™s Chandra Valley and Kullu Valley. The valley is perfect for trekking during the summer and winter months. It takes trekkers through alpine and rhododendron forests, green meadows, waterfalls and vertical rock fall while providing excellent views of the snow-covered Pir Panjal peaks. While the option to camp here is open throughout the year (near a riverside), the winter months offer the chance to set up a bonfire while having a hot meal.
